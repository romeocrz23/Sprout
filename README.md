Sprout UI Prototype (low-fidelity functional scaffolding)

Modules (from gathered/scanned materials):

- Budgeting (Budgets, Expenses, totals/remaining)
- Fitness & Diet (Plans, Workouts, Fitness Info, Diet)
- Calendar/Scheduling (Events with basic validation)
- Notes (Create/Edit/Delete + autosave)
- AI Chatbot (Send message, store responses)
- Auth (Register/Login) — stubbed (no real networking)

This UI uses in-memory state only.
